    <p>Dear Colleague,</p>
    <p> Kindly be informed that the Customer Complaint ID: {!Case.CaseNumber} has been changed to a status
        {!Case.Status} by {!Case.LastModifiedBy}. </p>
    <p> <strong>Next Steps (Complaint Coordinator & Investigation Team): </strong><br> During investigation, determine
        if the complaint is justified (is the issue real for the customer?) or *not justified. If justified, continue
        with full root cause analysis and identification/documentation of corrective actions. Update status to
        "Investigation Completed" and continue implementation of corrective actions. </p>
    <p>If complaint is not justified, stop further investigation and select "Not Justified" / reason to notify the
        Customer Caretaker to communicate this to the customer. Complaints that are "not justified" are typically when a
        customer is not cooperative with providing critical information like batch#, pictures, other evidence, or
        sending a sample to be analyzed.</p>
    <p>Best regards,</p>
    <p>Your CRM Support Team</p>
